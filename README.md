Data Analysis Project Analyzing the Relationship Between Union Density, GDP, and Income Inequality

The purpose of this project was to analyze the relationship between "Union Density" (the percentage of a country's labor force that is a member of a labor union) of OECD countries and their GDP and income inequality (measured using the "Gini Coefficient").

The included jupyter notebook contains the code used for the analysis. The deck provides the generated images with context. I'm currently in the process of building a Tableau Visualization, when it's complete I'll post a link here.
