Data Analysis Project Analyzing the Relationship Between Union Density, GDP, and Income Inequality

In the United States, the 2016 Republican Party platform declared: "[w]e support the right of states to enact Right-to-Work laws and call for a national law to protect the econoimc liberty of the modern workforce." Right-to-Work laws are generally considered to be deadly to labor unions and there is a strong hostility towards labor unions by the Republican and Libertarian parties. Why has one of the two major parties of the United States publicly declared its desire to destroy labor unions? What sort of effects do labor unions have on a country's economy? This brief analysis looks at union density (the percentage of the working population of a country that are members of a labor union) in OECD countries, and how it correlates with GDP and income inequality, measured using the Gini Coefficient.

The included jupyter notebook contains the code used for the analysis. The deck provides the generated images with context. I'm currently in the process of building a Tableau Visualization, when it's complete I'll post a link here.
